<h2>Liability for contents</h2>

<p>
We have taken great care in preparing the contents of this website.
However, we cannot assume liability for its correctness, completeness and up-to-dateness.

<h2>Liability for links to external contents</h2>

<p>
This website contains links to pages on third-party websites.
We have no control over the content of these third-party websites.
Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content.
At the time of linking, no infringing content was recognizable on third-party pages.
However, continuous monitoring of content on third-party pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of possible infringment.
If we become aware of infringing content on linked third-party pages, we will remove such links to that page immediately.
