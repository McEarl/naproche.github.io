<h1>Selected formalization projects</h1>
<p>
Formalizations in Naproche are often carried out by <!--bachelor and master--> students
as part of a practical project or a thesis.
On this page we present some of the larger formalizations projects in Naproche.
Please note that some formalizations only run in the respective contemporary version of Naproche.

<h2>Selection of Wiedijk’s 100 theorems</h2>
<p>
In the summer semester of 2023 Peter Koepke, Mateusz Marcol, and Patrick Schäfer
formalized some of <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/">Wiedijk’s 100 theorems</a>
and compiled them together with existing formalizations into a continuous document.
The formalization is part of the examples that ship with Naproche in the Isabelle (September 2023) distribution.
This work was presented at <a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/cambridge-2023/#koepke1">NatFoM 2023</a>.
You can also find the PDF version <a href="100_theorems.ftl.pdf">here</a> and the LaTeX source file <a href="https://github.com/naproche/naproche/blob/master/examples/100_theorems.ftl.tex">here</a>.

<h2>Initial chapters of Rudin’s <i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i></h2>
<p>
In 2022 ten students formalized the first 5 chapters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis"><i>Baby Rudin</i></a> while staying as close to the original text as possible. The formalization is available <a href="https://github.com/naproche/real-analysis">here</a>.

<h2>Set theory up to Silver’s theorem</h2>
<p>
In 2020 Jan Penquitt formalized set theory in Naproche up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X76900029">Silver’s theorem</a> about the continuum function at singular cardinals of uncountable cofinality.
This formalization was also
<a href="https://cicm-conference.org/2020/NFM/paper_1_Koepke_Penquitt_Schuetz_Sturzenhecker.pdf">presented at the NatFoM workshop</a> during CICM 2020.
